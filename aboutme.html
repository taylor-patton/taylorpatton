 <p> My name is Taylor Patton. I am 18 and from Milford, CT. I live with my older sister, Brittany, and my older brother, Ryan. One thing I love the most about going home on vacations is seeing my two dogs Lulu and Colby. They’re king charles cavaliers. In highschool I played Tennis and was the captain my senior year. Although I don’t play often here I still enjoy the sport. New York City is probably one of my favorite places and since I only live an hour away by train my friends from high school and I would take day trips there on the weekend! </p>
